### ABOUT ME

- Hi, I’m Owoyemi! I'm a software developer.

- 🔭  In a nutshell, I create websites that help organizations address business challenges and meet their needs.
- 🌱 I manage everything from website navigation and layout to a company's web hosting and security architecture.
- 🌱  I’m a lifelong learner (currently taking a course on building AI chatbots with Python! and also a student of ALX Africa),
- 👯  My expertise lies within both front-end & back-end web, I guess that makes me a full-stack developer and the main languages in my tech stack are C, Php/Mysqli, Sql, Javascript, and of course HTML/CSS. I’m looking to collaborate on any worklines in my field.
